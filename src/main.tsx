/**
 * Imported for its side effect, and it belongs in the ENTRY rather than beside
 * the `connect` call.
 *
 * The client installs the one `message` listener at module scope, so it is
 * listening as part of this bundle being evaluated — before React has rendered
 * anything, let alone run an effect. The host greets on the frame's `load`
 * event and effects run strictly after that, so a listener installed in
 * `useEffect` is installed after the greeting has already been posted and
 * thrown away. The essay is in the client's `mailbox.ts`; the only symptom is a
 * host reporting a module that will not speak.
 *
 * Here, from the entry, because a module scope that only a lazily-loaded chunk
 * imports is a module scope that has not run yet — the same bug wearing a
 * bundler's clothes. The package's `sideEffects` field names the client files
 * for the same reason.
