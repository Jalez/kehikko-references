/**
 * The bridge, and nothing about references.
 *
 * One conversation with one window, in the shape the protocol package defines.
 * It knows how to be greeted, how to ask a question and match the answer to it,
 * how to answer a `goto`, and how to say how tall it would like to be. It knows
 * nothing about issues, and the module that knows about issues knows nothing
 * about `postMessage`.
 *
 * ## Binding to the window, not to the origin
 *
 * This page has no `declares.storage`, so a roadmap frames it on an opaque
 * origin: it has no origin string of its own, every message it sends arrives
 * at the host with an origin of `"null"`, and every message it receives may
 * arrive with one too. `"null"` is a string that every sandboxed frame in every
 * tab shares, so it can never be an identity.
 *
 * What IS an identity is the window handle. The greeting arrives from exactly
 * one `MessageEvent.source`, and nothing in this page or any other page can
 * forge that handle — so the rule is the one the protocol's own note states:
 * bind to the window that greeted us, and after the greeting ignore anything
 * that did not come from it. Not because a stray message would be dangerous by
 * itself, but because a second sender answering our correlation ids is a page
 * that quietly shows another roadmap's work under this one's name.
 *
 * We reply with `targetOrigin: '*'`, and that is not laziness. There is nothing
 * secret in anything this page sends — the name of an epic somebody is already
 * reading — and a targeted origin here would have to be a guess: the
 * host's origin comes from `ev.origin`, which is `"null"` exactly when the host
 * itself is sandboxed. A guess that fails silently drops every message. Where
 * `ev.origin` is a real origin we use it, because then it is a fact rather than
 * a guess.
 *
 * ## Parse what the host sends, too
 *
 * A framed page receives every message posted at its window: the host's, a dev
 * server's hot-reload socket, an extension's. `looksLikeWireMessage` is the
 * cheap filter and `hostMessageSchema` is the real one. A module that trusted
 * `data.type` alone would be one that a bundler's socket can put into an
 * unexplained state on a Tuesday.

/**
 * Why a question came back without an answer.
 *
 * The protocol's three, plus one of our own. `silent` is the timeout, and it is
 * a separate word rather than folded into `failed` because the two send a
 * person to different places: `failed` is the roadmap telling us it went wrong,
 * and `silent` is the roadmap not being there — which, from inside a frame, is
 * indistinguishable from a host that is still starting up. The protocol names
 * the same condition `silent` on the other side of the wire, for a module that
 * was greeted and never answered; the symmetry is intentional.

 * had already come and gone, every time: the page rendered perfectly and the
 * pane beside it reported a module that would not speak. See the essay in

         was visible in the message, and was dropped one line before anything
         could act on it. There is nothing to see when that happens — no error,
         no warning, just a field that is never there — and Journeys needed a
         wire trace to find the same bug in its own copy of this code.

         removed, which are the two things a `ModuleContext` does not have. A

         tomorrow. `pinned` is already one of those: carried, honestly not acted
